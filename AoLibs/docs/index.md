# AoLibs

Set of various libraries that I happened to write during my Xamarin adventures. They are devised mainly for my own use but I took an effort to properly document them so that my co-workers or any other people I happen to develop with had easier time using these goodies.

!!! note
    I'm primarily developing on Android that's why Android side of thigs is better thought out and much richer than iOS counterpart. While all iOS thing should work they could certainly use an improvement.

Feel free to use this code in whatever way you see fit.

## Features 

Library supports _iOS_ and _Android_ projects. It's divided into three parts:

* [x] AoLibs.Navigation
	*  Provides cross platform navigation solution.
* [x] AoLibs.Adapters
	*  Various adapters gathering features that require writing platform specific code.
* [x] AoLibs.Utilities
	*  Completly random things that I tend to use in my projects.
  
## Dependencies

!!! info
	These libraries are built using MvvmLight libraries.
	Newtonsoft.Json is used for JSON serialization.
