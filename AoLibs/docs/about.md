!!! info
    If you are curious about the origin of AoLibs... well that's because I really like this kanji which happen to read like "Ao"
    
    <span style="font-size:3em;">è’¼</span>

    It means "blue"... but can also mean "green"... strange right? Hence the theme of upper header bar. From blue to green ^^ Japanese is for sure strange language.
