# AoLibs

Set of various libraries that I happened to write during my Xamarin adventures. They are in final stages of testing in real project. Later on I'll write proper docs and make the code more appropriate for nuget library.

> I'm currently writing docs in readmes. They will be visbile in repo and on [GitHub pages](https://drutol.github.io/AoLibs/)

## Features 

Library supports _iOS_ and _Android_ projects. It's divided into three parts:
* [AoLibs.Navigation](https://drutol.github.io/AoLibs/Navigation)
  * Provides cross platform navigation utilities.
* AoLibs.Adapters
  * Various adapters gathering features that require writing platform specific code.
* AoLibs.Utilities
  * Completly random things that I tend to use in my projects
  
## Dependencies

These libraries are built against MvvmLight libraries.
